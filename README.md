# ComicsXkcd


### Technical 
 The application was created upon a base structure develped by myself and practiced clean architecture, as well as unit testing for different modules.
 
 ##### MVP
 The MVP version of requested applicaiton contains:
 1. Comic Finder: explore through comic by using first, previous, next, last and random controllers
 2. Favorite: can add any shown comic to favorite list to save in database and show the favorite comics in offline mode as well
 3. Favorite List: showing favorites comics in online mode as well as offline mode
 
The implemented features were chosen to have the minimum proper functionality. Crash Reporter, UI Test, Proguard, and some of the unit tests weren't implemented due to having little time.

 ##### Some Future Features ideas
 1. Text to Speech feature to Read the comic for user
 2. Make the favorite comics available in different platforms(ios and android by registering the user)
 3. Shaking the device to show random comic
